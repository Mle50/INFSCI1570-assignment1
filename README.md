# Assignment 1 - My Favorites from Every Genre (or at least the genres I like)!!

## What kind of website did you make and why?

I created a website that has 4 musical genres and my favorite artists in them, and I decided on this because I love music, and wanted to list my favorite artists across all of my favorite muscial genres.

## Briefly describe the 5 pages you created for your site.

1. **Home**
   Overview of the website.

2. **Country**
   List of 5 country artists and an image of Dolly Parton (who else of course).

3. **Pop**
   Table comparing 3 of my favorite pop artists and their best albums (in my opinon).

4. **Musicals**
   List of top Broadway musicals/soundtracks.

5. **Classical**
   List of my favorite famous composers with a JavaScript toggle to hide/show the list.

## What were the HTML elements you used and why did you choose them?

- `<header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>, <article>.`
- `<ul>, <li>, <table>, <img>, <a>.`
- Class="intro-text" to style the home page differently so it stands out.

## What CSS styles did you apply to change the visual design of those HTML elements

- Changed the text style for the website.
- Header/nav bar/buttons that changes when hovered over.
- Styled table and lists.
- For dark mode toggle, I made a inverted class.

## Describe the Javascript code you wrote to add interactivity to your site.

- **Dark Mode Toggle:**  
  To create dark mode on the pages, there is a toggle button that is listened for in the JS file that changes the colors to dark mode when pressed.

- **Composer List Toggle:**  
  When the button is pressed, there is a toggle button that is listened for in the JS file that either shows or hides the list of classical composers.
